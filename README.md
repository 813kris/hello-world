Light heart. Gypsy Soul. I grew up on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. That, plus my eight years of marketing experience has given me a distinctive approach to design. Believer in white space. Lover of learning; personal growth is important. Somewhere in the middle of introvert and extrovert. Perfectionist to a fault - Iâ€™m working on that.
